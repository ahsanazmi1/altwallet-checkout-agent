feat(phase3): add decisioning & telemetry layer (v0.3.0)

Implements Phase 3 of the AltWallet Agent roadmap: Decisioning & Telemetry.

- Decision Contract
  • Standardized JSON with decision (APPROVE/REVIEW/DECLINE), actions (discount, KYC, loyalty), and reasons.
  • Consistent output across CLI, API, and structured logs.

- Routing Hints & Policy Flags
  • Added preferred_network, preferred_acquirer, surcharge/suppression indicators.
  • Integrated with Phase 2 scoring outputs (approval odds, preferences, penalties).

- Webhooks
  • Async event emitter for downstream events: auth_result, settlement, chargeback, loyalty_event.
  • Supports signed payloads and retry with exponential backoff.

- Telemetry & Analytics Schema
  • Structured JSON event schema capturing request_id, timestamp, decision, actions, routing hints, merchant_id, customer_id, latency, error_flags.
  • Logs ready for ingestion into Redash/Metabase.

- Dashboards
  • Starter SQL queries and JSON configs for Redash/Metabase.
  • Metrics: approval rates, decline reasons distribution, decision latency, surcharge/suppression frequency, loyalty events.

Artifacts:
- Updated OpenAPI schema (decision contract).
- Analytics schema JSON under /analytics/.
- Webhook emitter and docs.
- Dashboard configs.
- CI regression tests for contract validation, webhook delivery, telemetry event schema.

Release:
- Tagged as v0.3.0
