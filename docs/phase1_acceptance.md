# Phase 1 Acceptance Checklist

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for Phase 1 of the AltWallet Checkout Agent Core Engine MVP. Each item below should be verified by CI/CD pipelines and can be checked off when fully implemented and tested.

## Core Features

### ✅ Context Ingestion Models with Validation
- [x] Pydantic models for all context data structures
- [x] Validation for required fields and data types
- [x] Safe defaults and type coercions
- [x] `Context.from_json_payload()` method for ingestion
- [x] Comprehensive error handling for malformed data
- [x] Support for nested structures (cart, merchant, customer, device, geo)

**Verification**: Import models, create Context from JSON, validate all required fields

### ✅ Deterministic Scoring v1
- [x] Deterministic scoring algorithm implementation
- [x] Risk score calculation (0-100)
- [x] Loyalty boost calculation (0-50)
- [x] Final score computation (risk_score - loyalty_boost)
- [x] Routing hint generation based on score
- [x] Signal extraction for explainability
- [x] Consistent results for identical inputs

**Verification**: Run scoring on known inputs, verify deterministic output

### ✅ CLI with JSON Output
- [x] Typer-based CLI interface
- [x] `score` command for transaction scoring
- [x] JSON input from file or stdin
- [x] Single-line JSON output (compact format)
- [x] Pretty-print option for human readability
- [x] Trace ID generation and inclusion
- [x] Error handling with proper exit codes
- [x] Version command

**Verification**: CLI runs successfully, produces valid JSON output

### ✅ Structured JSON Logs with Trace IDs
- [x] Structured logging with JSON format
- [x] Trace ID generation and propagation
- [x] Request/response logging
- [x] Error logging with stack traces
- [x] Performance metrics logging
- [x] Configurable log levels
- [x] Thread-safe trace ID context

**Verification**: Logs are valid JSON, contain trace IDs, include required fields

### ✅ Golden Smoke Tests
- [x] Golden test framework implementation
- [x] Input/output test cases
- [x] Deterministic test execution
- [x] JSON normalization for comparison
- [x] Basic and risky transaction test cases
- [x] Automated test execution
- [x] Test result validation

**Verification**: Golden tests pass consistently, outputs match expected results

### ✅ FastAPI with /health and /score, OpenAPI Stub Emitted
- [x] FastAPI application setup
- [x] `/health` endpoint with status response
- [x] `/score` endpoint for transaction scoring
- [x] Request/response models with Pydantic
- [x] CORS middleware configuration
- [x] Trace ID middleware
- [x] OpenAPI schema generation
- [x] Schema export to `openapi/openapi.json`
- [x] Error handling with HTTP status codes
- [x] Request validation

**Verification**: API starts successfully, endpoints respond correctly, OpenAPI schema generated

### ✅ Versioned Docker Image Build
- [x] Multi-stage Dockerfile
- [x] Version argument support
- [x] Non-root user security
- [x] Optimized image size
- [x] Health check configuration
- [x] Proper labels and metadata
- [x] Exposed port configuration
- [x] Build script automation
- [x] Version file integration

**Verification**: Docker image builds successfully, contains all required components

## CI/CD Integration

### Automated Verification
- [x] Import tests for all modules
- [x] CLI functionality tests
- [x] API health check tests
- [x] Golden test execution
- [x] Docker build verification
- [x] Version consistency checks

### Quality Gates
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Code coverage thresholds met
- [x] Linting standards enforced
- [x] Security scanning passed
- [x] Performance benchmarks met

## Usage Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Score a transaction from file
python -m altwallet_agent score --input examples/context_basic.json

# Score from stdin
echo '{"cart": {...}}' | python -m altwallet_agent score

# Pretty output
python -m altwallet_agent score --input input.json --pretty
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Score transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"context_data": {"cart": {...}}}'
```

### Docker Usage
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t altwallet-agent:0.1.0 .

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:8080 altwallet-agent:0.1.0
```

## Verification Script

Run the verification script to check all Phase 1 requirements:

```bash
python scripts/verify_phase1.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ All Phase 1 requirements PASSED
- Context ingestion models: PASS
- Deterministic scoring: PASS
- CLI with JSON output: PASS
- Structured JSON logs: PASS
