# Phase 4 — Platformization Guardrails

This document defines the mandatory guardrails for all Phase 4 development work to ensure quality, maintainability, and backward compatibility.

## 🛡️ Core Guardrails

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- **MUST NOT** break Phase 1–3 functionality
- All existing APIs, CLI commands, and configurations must remain functional
- New features must be additive, not replacing existing functionality
- Breaking changes require explicit approval and migration documentation

### 2. Testing Requirements
- **MUST** have stubbed tests or golden tests in place before merge
- New deployment profiles require integration tests
- SDK examples must have corresponding test cases
- All new features must have at least 80% test coverage

### 3. Structured Logging Compliance
- **MUST** continue structured JSON logging with trace IDs
- All new components must use the existing logging framework
- Log format: `{"ts": "ISO8601", "level": "INFO", "component": "module", "request_id": "uuid", "latency_ms": 123}`
- No PII in logs, support for `LOG_SILENT=1` flag

### 4. Modular Architecture
- **MUST** follow provider framework from Phase 3
- Code must be modular and loosely coupled
- New components must implement provider interfaces
- Configuration must be externalized and environment-specific

### 5. CI/CD Gates
- **MUST** have CI gate that blocks merge if:
  - Deployment profiles are missing
  - SDK examples are missing
  - Tests are failing
  - Code coverage drops below threshold

## 📋 Pre-Merge Checklist

Before any Phase 4 PR can be merged, verify:

- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**
  - [ ] All existing tests pass
  - [ ] CLI commands work unchanged
  - [ ] API endpoints remain functional
  - [ ] Configuration files are compatible

- [ ] **Testing Coverage**
  - [ ] New features have test stubs
  - [ ] Integration tests for deployment profiles
  - [ ] SDK examples have test cases
  - [ ] Golden tests updated if needed

- [ ] **Logging Compliance**
  - [ ] Structured JSON logs implemented
  - [ ] Trace IDs present in all log entries
  - [ ] No PII in log output
  - [ ] `LOG_SILENT=1` support verified

- [ ] **Architecture Compliance**
  - [ ] Provider framework patterns followed
  - [ ] Modular design principles applied
  - [ ] Configuration externalized
  - [ ] Dependencies properly managed

- [ ] **CI/CD Requirements**
  - [ ] Deployment profiles present
  - [ ] SDK examples documented
  - [ ] All CI checks passing
  - [ ] Code coverage maintained

## 🔧 Implementation Guidelines

### Provider Framework Compliance
```python
# Example: New deployment provider
class DeploymentProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def deploy(self, config: DeploymentConfig) -> DeploymentResult:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def health_check(self) -> HealthStatus:
        pass
```

### Structured Logging Pattern
```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger("component_name")

def process_request(request_id: str, data: dict):
    logger.info(
        "Processing request",
        request_id=request_id,
        component="deployment_manager",
        latency_ms=calculate_latency()
    )
```

### Test Stub Template
```python
def test_new_feature():
    """Test stub for new Phase 4 feature."""
    # Arrange
    config = TestConfig()
    
    # Act
    result = new_feature.process(config)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.status == "success"
    assert result.latency_ms < 1000
```

## 🚨 Enforcement

### Automated Checks
- CI pipeline runs all guardrail checks
- Pre-commit hooks validate logging format
- Code coverage gates prevent merge
- Integration tests verify deployment profiles

### Manual Review
- Architecture review for provider framework compliance
- Security review for PII handling
- Performance review for latency requirements
- Documentation review for completeness

## 📊 Metrics

Track compliance with:
- Test coverage percentage
- CI pipeline success rate
- Logging format compliance
- Deployment profile completeness
- SDK example coverage

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

- Weekly guardrail compliance review
- Monthly architecture pattern updates
- Quarterly testing framework improvements
- Annual security and performance audits
