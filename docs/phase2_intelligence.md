# Phase 2 - Intelligence Layer Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 2 introduces intelligent decision-making capabilities to the AltWallet Checkout Agent, building upon the solid foundation established in Phase 1. This phase focuses on implementing actual business logic for checkout processing, transaction scoring, and card recommendations.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Intelligent Checkout Processing**: Replace mock implementations with actual business logic
2. **Advanced Transaction Scoring**: Implement multi-factor scoring algorithms
3. **Smart Card Recommendations**: Build recommendation engines with real card data
4. **Risk Assessment**: Add fraud detection and risk scoring capabilities
5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and optimization strategies

### Quality Requirements
- Clear docstrings for all functions and classes
- Comprehensive unit tests with pytest
- Golden test fixtures for deterministic outputs
- JSON structured logging with request_id correlation
- Updated README and OpenAPI documentation
- Small, atomic PRs with short CHANGELOG entries

    risk_context: RiskContext | None = None

class IntelligenceResponse(BaseModel):
    """Enhanced response with intelligence insights."""
    recommendations: list[CardRecommendation]
    risk_assessment: RiskAssessment
    fraud_indicators: list[FraudIndicator]
    confidence_score: float
    reasoning: dict[str, Any]

class CardRecommendation(BaseModel):
    """Detailed card recommendation with reasoning."""
    card_id: str
    card_name: str
