# Phase 2 Definition of Done (DoD)

This document tracks the completion criteria for Phase 2 of the AltWallet Checkout Agent, ensuring all intelligence layer features are properly implemented and validated.

## Core Functionality

- [ ] Scorer returns calibrated p_approval with deterministic behavior
- [ ] Preference/loyalty weights + merchant penalties integrated into utility
- [ ] Explainability returns additive contributions that sum to raw score

## API & Integration

- [ ] OpenAPI v1.0.0 served; /v1/score, /v1/explain, /healthz, /version live
- [ ] Golden fixtures & snapshots stable; CI green

## User Experience & Documentation

- [ ] CLI prints Phase-2 fields; structured logs validated
- [ ] README updated with examples and troubleshooting

## Validation Checklist

### Scorer Implementation
- [ ] ApprovalScorer returns p_approval between 0.0 and 1.0
- [ ] Same inputs always produce same outputs (deterministic)
- [ ] Calibration layer properly maps raw scores to probabilities
- [ ] Feature attributions are additive and sum to raw score

### Utility Computation
- [ ] Composite utility formula implemented: `utility = p_approval × expected_rewards × preference_weight × merchant_penalty`
- [ ] Preference weighting considers loyalty tiers and user preferences
- [ ] Merchant penalties account for network preferences and MCC categories
- [ ] Expected rewards calculation includes category bonuses

### Explainability
- [ ] Feature contributions are additive and sum to raw score
- [ ] Top drivers are correctly identified and ranked
- [ ] Audit information includes config versions and request IDs
- [ ] Explainability data is included in API responses

### API Endpoints
- [ ] POST /v1/score returns enhanced recommendations with utility scores
- [ ] POST /v1/explain returns detailed feature attributions
- [ ] GET /v1/healthz provides health status
- [ ] GET /v1/version returns version information
- [ ] OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification is valid and complete

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Golden regression tests pass consistently
- [ ] All test fixtures produce expected outputs
- [ ] CI pipeline shows green status
- [ ] Fast unit tests complete in < 1 second
- [ ] Smoke tests validate core functionality

### CLI & Logging
- [ ] CLI displays Phase 2 fields (p_approval, utility, explainability)
- [ ] Structured logging includes intelligence insights
- [ ] JSON logs contain required fields (ts, level, component, request_id, latency_ms)
- [ ] No PII included in logs

### Documentation
- [ ] README includes Phase 2 features and examples
- [ ] Example contexts provided for quick verification
- [ ] Troubleshooting section covers common issues
- [ ] API documentation links to OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Regression test instructions included
